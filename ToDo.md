Figure out how to avoid importing interfaces. Seems like when it was in Definitions folder, NOT having the "export" keyword made it so they could be recognized globally. 

Typescript is not throwing errors when it should! Look into the tsconfigurations.

# Noteworthy

  App is using babel macros for styled components, CRA 2.x, typescript, react hooks.
